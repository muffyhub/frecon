# F-recon
Hi, This is a short reconnaissance script which I had started writing some time back. It uses various open source tools to collect data and perform various task automatically on a given domain.<br>
P.S: <i>This is a script which I had created for personal use with with an intention to learn automation with bash and have no intention for commercial/ professional purpose. (You will find scripts which are far better than this one)</i><br><br>
Currently it performs following tasks:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Subdomain Enumeration</li>
  <li>Probing domains on HTTP/HTTPS</li>
  <li>Check for live hosts: Ping Sweep</li>
  <li>Check Status Codes</li>
  <li>Convert domains to IP addresses</li>
  <li>Port Scanning</li>
  <li>Taking screenshots of all the subdomains</li>
  <li>Getting some information from wayback archieve</li>
  <li>Check domains against subdomain takeover vulnerability</li>
</ol>
